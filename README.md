- 👋 Hello World, I’m @cpn595
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Machine Learning, Coding, Multimedia production and article, books, online classes creation.
- 🌱 I’m currently remembering how to think like a coder!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I am invited that matches myself 
- 📫 How to reach me ... I doubt anyone would like to reach me, but, anyways, webpageshpro@protonmail.com

Totally noob intro, so is me after a decade without serious coding. I'll start with ASM and then rise up the level. The inverse way!
